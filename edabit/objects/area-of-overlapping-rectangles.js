/*
Area of Overlapping Rectangles
https://edabit.com/challenge/dejHsfH2qWpgu4CGC

Problem
------------------------------------------
Create a function that returns the area of the overlap between two rectangles.
The function will receive two rectangles, each with the coordinates of two of
its opposite angles.

Inputs: Two arrays containing coordinates for the bottom-left and top-right
corners of rectangles.
- Coordinates can be positive or negative integers.
Outputs: 1 integer, the area of the overlap

Rules, Requirements, Definitions
- There may be no overlap: Return 0.


Clarifying Questions
- Order of coordinates? Seems to be bottom-left first and then top-right, but
  assume it could be any two diagonally-opposite corners.

Edge Cases
- Rectangles share a border but do not overlap: Return 0.
- One rectangle completely inside the other: Return the area of the enclosed
  rectangle.
- Zero-area rectangle? Possible.


Examples, Test Cases
------------------------------------------
overlappingRectangles(
  [{ x: 2, y: 1 }, { x: 5, y: 5 }],
  [{ x: 3, y: 2 }, { x: 5, y: 7 }]
) âžž 6

Idea: Determine horizontal overlap, then multiply by vertical overlap.
Rect1 spans x from 2-5
Rect1 spans x from 3-5
Overlap is 3-5 => width of 2
Rect1 spans y from 1-5
Rect1 spans y from 2-7
Overlap is 2-5 => height of 3
Multiply: 2 * 3 = 6

Data Structure
------------------------------------------
Use variables to track spans.

Algorithm
------------------------------------------
- Take max of x coordinates of rect1, coord1.
- Take min of x coordinates of rect1, coord2.
- Take the difference as xOverlap.
- Take max of y coordinates of rect1, coord1.
- Take min of y coordinates of rect1, coord2.
- Take the difference as yOverlap.
- Multiply xOverlap and yOverlap.
